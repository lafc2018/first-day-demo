      <p>After reviewing the keys to success, I would have to say the most challenging will be “Put in the Time”. Thankfully I am a full-time employee and father to a one-year-old but that does not leave me with much extra time. I have taken the following steps to help me succeed with this key. I have purchased a planner in which I have entered all my class dates and will enter my future assignments to keep me up to date constantly. I have also stepped away from any other extra activities/hobbies I was part of outside of work. I have also set aside 2-4 hours a day to work on coding and classwork after the baby has fallen asleep. I know these changes will allow me to “Put in the Time” necessary to succeed in this course and in my career. </p>
